# BloodBank

The idea is to connect blood donor and blood receiver through mobile app. It has login/Signup feature implemented through 
firebase authentication, the user can see the list of matching donors respective to his/her blood group, can add custom 
request of any blood group, can interact with the respective person through live chat (using real time firebase), 
and can manage his/her profile.
